# python-api-challenge
Xpert learning assistant was used to fix my code to created the first map plot in VacationPy so that the OSM tiles could be displayed and have the world map in the background. During a tutoring session with Emmanuel, he helped me correct a few typos so that my code would properly retrive the data and list cities. One of these typos was city_lat = city_weather["Lat"] and Emmanuel helped me figure out that it should be city_lat = city_weather["coord"]["lat"] and that Lng should be lon, this resulted in the code fetching city names whereas before no cities were retrieved.
